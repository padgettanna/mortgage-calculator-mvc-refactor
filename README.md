# Mortgage Calculator Web Application

A mortgage loan calculator web application built with C# and ASP.NET Core MVC. This application helps users calculate monthly mortgage payments, determine loan eligibility, and understand the financial implications of their home purchase.

## Project Status

This project is actively under development as part of a Computer Science capstone.
It originated as a console-based mortgage calculator and is being incrementally
refactored and expanded into a full ASP.NET Core MVC web application.

## Features

- **Mortgage Payment Calculator**: Calculate monthly mortgage payments including principal and interest
- **Loan Eligibility Assessment**: Determine if the borrower qualifies based on income-to-payment ratio
- **Comprehensive Fee Calculation**: Includes:
  - Origination fees
  - Closing costs
  - Property tax
  - Homeowners insurance
  - HOA fees
  - Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) when applicable
- **Multiple Loan Terms**: Support for different loan term lengths
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, responsive design for easy data entry
- **Results Flow**: Temporarily preserves loan input to support recalculation and adjustment

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core MVC
- **.NET Version**: .NET 10
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with separate domain layer
